        <h3>Tips & Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your beans are well-picked and clean before you use them. Chewing on rotten beans or stones is not always a fun experience</li>
            <li>Some beans are full of pesticides, and the water can get dark and nasty. If that is the case, please drain the beans halfway during the cooking time, rinse them, and replace with clean water before continuing the cooking process.</li>
            <li>I used the long-grain rice, thats why i cooked the rice for about 20 minutes, but you will end up with well-separated grains, which I love. Please follow the cooking instructions for your Rice.</li>
